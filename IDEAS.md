# Suggested Ideas.

1. Build a smart-contract library that can be used(called) on any deployed smart contract, to track it's **payment** and other sensitive on-chain activities - with event emissions - hence off-chain alerts. Thus helping to track and prevent fraudulent on-chain activities. Build it into a sass with services(web, mobile or hopefully both) for the notifications/alerts.

Name inspiration: Telmy(from 'tell me').

2. Build 'Block Ledger' into a saas product where users can create accounts, and deploy ledger contracts by themselves(for personal use, for their business, or otherwise) and bring their financial activities on-chain.
