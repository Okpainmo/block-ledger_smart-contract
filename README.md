# block-ledger_smart-contract.

Smart contract project for 'Block Ledger'.

'Block Ledger' is a blockchain ledger project.

> A ledger is a structured record of financial transactions, usually used in accounting to track debits, credits, and balances over time for individuals, accounts, or businesses.

**Basically a system that records payments(in and out), tracks users, and stores payment details for a platform(smart contract) - on the blockchain**.

A special statement on the global move towards **on-chain finance**.

Suggested Idea: 

1. Build a smart-contract library that can be used(called) on any deployed smart contract, to track it's **payment** and other sensitive on-chain activities - with event emissions - hence off-chain alerts. Thus helping to track and prevent fraudulent on-chain activities.

2. Build 'Block Ledger' into a saas product where users can create accounts, and deploy ledger contracts by themselves(for personal use, for their business, or otherwise) and bring their financial activities on-chain.

## Features.

- wallet log-in(only contract deployer has access).
- associate accounts: the ability to create associate accounts(favorites in web2 terms - basically entities that you world be transacting with often). This removes the need to keep providing user details anytime you wish to make a transaction.
- track all in-coming and outgoing transactions - via on-chain events - hence off-chain notifications/alerts.
- ...more coming.
