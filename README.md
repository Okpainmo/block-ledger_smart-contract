# block-ledger_smart-contract.

Smart contract project for 'Block Ledger'.

'Block Ledger' is a blockchain ledger project.

> A ledger is a structured record of financial transactions, usually used in accounting to track debits, credits, and balances over time for individuals, accounts, or businesses.

**Basically a system that records payments(in and out), tracks users, and stores payment details for a platform(smart contract) - on the blockchain**.

A special statement on the global move towards **on-chain finance**.

## Features.

- wallet log-in(only contract deployer has access).
- associate accounts: the ability to create associate accounts('favorites' in web2 terms - basically entities that you would be transacting with quite often). This removes the need to keep providing user details anytime you wish to make a transaction to such accounts.
- track all in-coming and outgoing transactions - via on-chain events - hence off-chain notifications/alerts.
- ...more coming.
