Smart contract project for 'Block Ledger'.

'Block Ledger' is a blockchain ledger project.

> A ledger is a structured record of financial transactions, usually used in accounting to track debits, credits, and balances over time for individuals, accounts, or businesses.

**Basically a system that records payments(in and out), tracks users, and stores payment details for a platform(smart contract) - on the blockchain**.

A special statement on the global move towards **on-chain finance**.

Suggested Idea: Build a smart-contract library that can be used on any deployed smart contract, to track it's **payment** and other sensitive on-chain activities - with event emissions - hence off-chain alerts. Thus helping to track and prevent fraudulent on-chain activities.
